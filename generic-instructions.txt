* Read and Learn
  To get maximum time-management benefit, you are encouraged to:
  - track your time for each task (TODO);
  - mark each task DONE when done (type t to toggle its state); and
  - maintain a time-tracking summary report.

  With your cursor on a TODO line, comma I (, I) runs the =org-clock-in=
  command, and comma O (, O) runs the =org-clock-out= command.

  Afterwards, clicking/confirming the link below will insert a table with a
  clock report right below the link. Once inserted, running the link again
  (which can also be done by hitting the Return/Enter key with the cursor in the
  link) will update the table. For your convenience, this link will appear in
  every file.

  [[elisp:(org-clock-report 1)][Insert/Update Clock Summary Report]]

  For example, the bullets below specify two tasks you can practice on. For more
  advice, see the [[file:time-considerations.txt][time-considerations.txt]] file.

* TODO Reading Assignment
  Read the textbook\rsquo{}s introductory material (everything before ABC --- which
  means everything up to and including section ONE subsubsection ONI, which ends
  just when subsection ABC begins).

  Take notes, inserting them here.

* TODO Export to See Formatted File
  If you want to see what your file will look like when formatted like The Book,
  run the link below:

  [[elisp:(browse-url-of-file (org-html-export-to-html))][Export to HTML and Browse]]

  Note that, again for your convenience, one of these links will appear in every
  file.

* How To Avoid MIsery
  Take Care of the Mechanics! (And yes, the MI in MIsery was intentional!)

  Do you take pride in your writing? Enough to free it of *mechanical
  infelicities* (MIs --- e.g., misspelled words, grammatical errors, punctuation
  errors, formatting errors)?

  Even if you are hard pressed to produce good solutions, you can always take
  steps to eliminate MIs in the solutions you do write up, for example:

  1. Spell-check and grammar-check your writing. (Have you heard of Grammarly?)
  2. Read your writing aloud (or better yet, have someone else read it to you)
     to see how it sounds.
  3. Have someone who is good at English carefully proofread your writing.

  Besides a mathematical inclination, an exceptionally good mastery of one\rsquo{}s
  native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent programmer.

* How To Install the Source Code Pro Fonts
  Simplified from the https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro source:

  Download and unzip [[https://rickneff.github.io/source-code-pro-true-type-font-files-plus-windows-installer.zip][this .zip file]]:

** MacOs
   Use the Font Book app, and Add Fonts from the folder created by unzipping.

** Linux
   You\rsquo{}re on your own for which program to use, but having that program read the
   .ttf files (that you unzipped) will probably work.

** Windows
   Use the files you unzipped. Here are the instructions extracted from
   [[https://rickneff.github.io/fontreg-2.1.3-redist.zip]]:

   If you...

   ...run FontReg.exe without any command-line switches:

  + FontReg will remove any stale font registrations in the registry.
  + FontReg will repair any missing font registrations for fonts located in
    the C:\Windows\Fonts directory (this step will be skipped for .fon fonts if
    FontReg cannot determine which fonts should have "hidden" registrations).

  ...run FontReg.exe with the /copy or /move switch:

  + FontReg will install all files with a .fon, .ttf, .ttc, or .otf file
    extension located in the CURRENT DIRECTORY (which might not necessarily be
    the directory in which FontReg is located).  Installation will entail
    copying/moving the files to C:\Windows\Fonts and then registering the fonts.
  + FontReg will remove any stale font registrations in the registry.
  + FontReg will repair any missing font registrations for fonts located in
    the C:\Windows\Fonts directory (this step will be skipped for .fon fonts if
    FontReg cannot determine which fonts should have "hidden" registrations).

  FontReg.exe is intended as a replacement for Microsoft's outdated fontinst.exe,
  and like fontinst.exe, FontReg.exe is fully silent--it will not print messages,
  pop up dialogs, etc.; the process exit code will be 0 if there was no error.
