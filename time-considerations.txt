* A Time For Everything
  As mentioned in the [[file:generic-instructions.txt][generic-instructions.txt]] file, you are encouraged to keep
  track of how long you spend on reading the book and doing each EPP. This
  should be *focused*, *concentrated* time --- so stop the clock before taking a
  break (for any reason, especially unexpected interruptions). Org-mode makes it
  easy to stop and restart timers.

  One reason you would do well to carefully track your time is to avoid burnout.
  In accordance with the standard \ldquo{}formula\rdquo (caveat --- only for an average
  student seeking an average grade) that you should expect to spend two hours
  outside of class for every hour in, you are not *expected* to work more than
  10 hours per week on this class. (You are also not *forbidden* to work more
  than that. Your choice.) Note that 10 hours is 8 hours in addition to the 2
  you spend in class. That is *double* the outside-of-class hours of the
  above-mentioned standard --- the reason being that this is a more demanding
  course, and you are above-average students, or else you would not be seeking
  the degrees you are.

* Advice for the Wise
  As managing time well is crucial to success in life, BYU-Idaho has some
  helpful advice here:

  Here is a quote from the STUDY HOURS FORMULA section:

  To decide how many hours you need to study each week in order to get A\rsquo{}s, use
  this rule of thumb:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Study two hours per credit hour for a lighter class, three hours per credit
   hour for an average class, and four hours per credit hour for a difficult
   class.
#+END_QUOTE

   Most students consider this a difficult class, hence 4 hours per credit hour
   equals 8 hours a week of study outside of class. Quoting again from the Time
   Management page:

   To ease your anxiety, remember that it is not only the quantity of study
   time, but also the quality of study time that counts. This formula is just a
   general guideline. You might try following it for a week, making adjustments
   as needed.
