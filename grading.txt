* Hints for DM1 Week 01\rsquo{}s Assignment
  In aaa-01.txt there are six assigned EPPs: CRC, DGZ, CHJ, DZB, DOB, and CJF.

  First, a Hint about Hints:

  With your cursor on a :HINT: line, pressing TAB will toggle the open/close
  state of these \ldquo{}drawers\rdquo, as org-mode refers to them.

  They are all closed when you first open this file. Open them only after you
  take the opportunity to see how far you can get without them. (If you\rsquo{}ve been
  getting tutoring help from my TAs, they may have already given you these or
  similar (or better!) hints. And that\rsquo{}s okay, as long as you took care and
  responsibility for your own learning by grappling with them first.)

  Also, at the top of this file note the \ldquo{}not\rdquo in the first #+options: header.
  This controls the invisibility of the HINT drawers when exporting this org
  file to html, which you can do by the following key sequence:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  , e e h o
#+END_EXAMPLE

  - CRC
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Do not be picky about the wording \ldquo{}There is no right answer,\rdquo which
            could be interpreted as \ldquo{}There is no answer that you could give that
            would be right.\rdquo That would be a misinterpretation.
:END:

  - DGZ
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Lewis Carroll is your friend here.
:END:

  - CHJ
:HINT:
  - Hint :: A \ldquo{}word\rdquo with no vowels is a clear winner of the largest contest --
            a CVR can\rsquo{}t be greater than infinity. So don\rsquo{}t count those CVRs.
            That way, \lsquo{}What\rsquo and \lsquo{}word\rsquo would be tied for first place at a ratio
            of 3 to 1 (3:1).
  - Also :: Count /y/ as a vowel, even when it is the first letter of a word.
:END:

  - DZB
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Another name for this problem is the /Limiting Radius/ problem, and
            a /trigonometric approach/ to it is suggested by this image:

            [[https://rickneff.github.io/img/limiting-radius-problem-solution-attempt.png]]
:END:

  - DOK
:HINT:
  - Hint :: In case it wasn\rsquo{}t clear, you are being asked to form the product of
            3 numbers. And to do that over and over again, as many times as it
            takes.
  - Hint :: Try dividing all the products by 6.
  - Time Hint :: There is another connection to be made, but to pursue this
                 quest is potentially time-consuming.
:END:

  - CJF
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Split the 6-digit number into two 3-digit numbers, and think of the
            word CLOCK (what CLAHCK really should be) as a sequence of 5 letters:
: 654 321
:
: C L O C K
:END:

* Grading Overview
  As stated in the syllabus, assignments are weighted at 70% of your final
  grade. These assignments consist of reading the book and working the
  exercises, problems and puzzles (EPPs) therein.

  Each aaa-##.txt file will have the structure:

  1. Top-level headings for Exercises, Problems, and Puzzles
  2. Second-level headings for each three-letter acronym.

* Grading Breakdown
  For computing the grade for EPPs, there are five \ldquo{}raw\rdquo score components or
  factors:

  1. Ex for Exercises
  2. Pr for Problems
  3. Pu for Puzzles
  4. Mc for Mechanical care
  5. Tt for Time tracking

  These are explained below. The calculation for the \ldquo{}cooked\rdquo score to be entered
  for you into my gradebook is:
#+begin_src elisp
  (* (+ (* Ex Pr) Pu Mc) Tt)
#+end_src

  Note that all cooked scores are normalized to 100 points possible. You will
  also note that the same score can be achieved through a variety of different
  strategies (see below).
** Exercises
    Each exercise solution is either right or wrong (1 or 0). The Ex factor is
    the number correct divided by the total number, making a number between 0.0
    and 1.0 its value.
** Problems
    All problems are weighted equally on a scale from 1-10. The Pr factor is the
    *average* of these divided by 10, so it also has a value between 0.0 and 1.0
    (but possibly more).
*** Attempt
     0-6: You made an attempt, your score is determined by how far you got.
*** Success
     7: You reached the desired output/answer by proceeding in a
     straightforward, brute-force manner --- not including just searching for
     and finding someone else\rsquo{}s answer.
*** General
     8-9: Your solution is worth more if it works for all input(s) with error
     checking and test cases.
*** Elegant
     10-15: The more elegant, the more points.
** Puzzles
    Each puzzle has four point scales (see below), which are typically presented
    following the problem definition in the aaa-##.txt file. You can earn points
    for each of them *independently*, which means you do not have to do them *all*
    to get *some* points. The average over all puzzles of the sum of these four
    components is the Pu factor.
*** Rephrase
     0.0 - 0.1: a textual description showing you understand the \ldquo{}heart of the
     problem\rdquo.
*** Approach
     0.0 - 0.2: a textual description of how you approached solving the problem.
*** Solution
     0.0 - 0.3: the solution itself. Points are only awarded if it works or the
     correct answer is reached.
*** Proof
     0.0 - 0.3 (or more): a textual description of how we know the solution is
     correct. The more robust the argument, the higher the points.
** Mechanical care
   This factor measures if or to what degree your writing is free of *MIs* (recall
   [[file:generic-instructions.txt::*How%20To%20Avoid%20MIsery][How To Avoid MIsery]]?). Scaled to 100 points possible, the bonus points are:

   - 0 for 4 or more MIs
   - 1 for 3 MIs
   - 2 for 2 MIs
   - 4 for 1 MI
   - 8 for 0 MIs
   - 16 for being the first to find and report some MI in anything Brother Neff
     has written to be disseminated; namely, The Book, and any other course
     files.

   Be aware that the Mc factor *only applies* if the product of Ex (Exercises) and
   Pr (Problems) is 0.5 (50%) or higher. Otherwise you could do nothing and
   still get points for having no MIs in your non-existent writing!

   You must put your answers for Exercises and Problems in the supplied \ldquo{}info\rdquo
   blocks, e.g.,
#+begin_info
  Your answer goes here.
#+end_info
   removing \ldquo{}Your answer goes here.\rdquo of course. *Failure to do so* counts as a
   formatting error --- an MI.

   You can see that putting code inside this info block turns off its (the
   code\rsquo{}s) helpful colorization (syntax highlighting). So just put your solution
   descriptions inside --- code blocks can go outside and just below these info
   blocks.

   Note that there is a different way to format your answers to the Puzzles, by
   using the four supplied subheadings: Rephrase, Approach, Solution and Proof.

* Other Factors
  Ignoring the Tt factor for now, here are some ways the same overall score can
  be achieved, for example, 90%:
  1. 100% on exercises, 90% on problems, nothing on puzzles.
  2. 90% on exercises, 100% on problems, nothing on puzzles.
  3. 90% on exercises, 90% on problems, and 9% extra credit on puzzles.

** Now About Tt
   Review how to use org-mode features to keep track of your time for this class
   in [[file:time-considerations.txt::*A%20Time%20For%20Everything][time-considerations.txt]]. There it uses the verb *encouraged* and gives one
   reason why you would do well to carefully track your time.

   Another reason for doing this tracking is that failure to do so in the
   prescribed manner will negatively affect your grade! In other words, I am
   changing *encouraged* to *required*, and to be precise:

   The Tt factor is 100 minus the following:

   - 1 point for each EPP you did (and marked DONE) that you failed to track.
   - *10 points* for failure to include an *accurate clock summary report*.

*** VERY IMPORTANT --- PLEASE READ AND HEED
   As a very strong incentive to pay attention to this detail, starting with
   Week 02 my graders will only grade the EPPs that are marked DONE.

   Please don\rsquo{}t do a lot of work and then fail to get any points for it! Even if
   you don\rsquo{}t finish, mark it DONE so you can get partial credit for what you did
   do. In other words, use the toggling from TODO to DONE to signify that you
   are done working on it, not that there was nothing more you could have done.

*** But What If I\rsquo{}m Already Done?!
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2020-04-24 Fri 08:45]--[2020-04-24 Fri 08:45] =>  0:00
    :END:
    If you\rsquo{}ve already finished (or are well underway with) this week\rsquo{}s
    assignment --- good for you! But please go back in and start and then
    immediately stop the timer for each EPP. This will record an elapsed time of
    0:00 --- like in the timestamp for this item that I just did what I just
    asked you to do. Opening the LOGBOOK drawer (recall how to open drawers?)
    reveals the CLOCK property with its value:

    CLOCK: [2020-04-24 Fri 08:45]--[2020-04-24 Fri 08:45] =>  0:00

    You can manually edit either the starting time or the ending time (or both
    if that\rsquo{}s easier) to reflect your *best guesstimate* of how much time you
    really spent. After changing one or both timestamps, press that ever-handy
    multi-purpose key sequence

    , ,

    and the timestamp will be updated to show the new elapsed time. Like this:

    CLOCK: [2020-04-24 Fri 08:45]--[2020-04-24 Fri 08:56] =>  0:11

    Voil\agrave!

    But wait, you\rsquo{}re not quite done yet. That 10-point penalty for failure to
    include an accurate clock summary report is completely avoidable, if you
    remember to hit this link (at the top of every assignment file) just before
    you submit it:

    [[elisp:(org-clock-report 1)][Insert/Update Clock Summary Report]]

    If the report is not there, or if it is but my graders hit that link and
    notice the report changes (meaning it was not completely up-to-date ---
    hence, not accurate), they will be merciless in exacting that 10-point
    penalty. :-(

* Assignment Weighting
  As incentive for you to stay the course, and avoid discouragement if the
  course seems overwhelming at this early date, I am going to weight your 13
  assignments unequally and increasingly over time, as follows:

  | Assignment | Weight |
  |------------+--------|
  |         01 |    2.0 |
  |         02 |    2.5 |
  |         03 |    3.0 |
  |         04 |    3.5 |
  |         05 |    4.0 |
  |         06 |    4.5 |
  |         07 |    5.0 |
  |         08 |    5.5 |
  |         09 |    6.0 |
  |         10 |    7.0 |
  |         11 |    8.0 |
  |         12 |    9.0 |
  |         13 |   10.0 |

  You will note that the sum of the second column is 70.0 --- the total weight
  of the Assignments category. So yes, the last assignment (perhaps the easiest
  one, BTW) is worth 10% of your overall grade. And your first assignment, which
  is considerably harder even with only six EPPs, is a meager 2%. The idea is,
  if you start strong, you can keep getting stronger, and will be rewarded for
  your tenacity and perseverance. If you start weak, it won\rsquo{}t hurt you that
  much, and if you decide to overcome that weakness you can still finish strong!
